# StreetTalk (2021)
 
This is StreetTalk, a .NET web application that allows users to share information about their neighborhood and connect with their community. We used Entity Framework Core and a SQL database to store user info such as comments. We also have tests.

In this app you can make an account, create posts, and leave comments on posts. There is also a map view to see posts in a users neighborhood, you can search for posts by keyword, and you can filter posts. Users can follow users and get notifications of new posts.

Tech used: 
.NET Core, 
Entity Framework Core, 
Razor, 
xUnit
