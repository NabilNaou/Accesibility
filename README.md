# StreetTalk (2021)
 
This repository contains the code for StreetTalk, a .NET web application that allows users to share information about their neighborhood and connect with their community. The application uses Entity Framework Core and a fully functional database to store user information, posts, and comments. The project includes a set of tests to ensure the application is working correctly.

StreetTalk allows users to create an account, create posts, and leave comments on posts. The application includes features such as a map view to easily see posts in a user's neighborhood, the ability to search for posts by keyword, and the ability to filter posts by category. Users can also connect with other users by following them and can receive notifications when there are new posts or comments in their neighborhood.
